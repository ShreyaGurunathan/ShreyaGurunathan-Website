        <div class="subheading mb-5">Nueroscience Biotechüìö</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a third year neuroscience major at the University of California, Riverside. My future career goal is to work at a biotech company that has ties to hospitals and medical centers for a few years after graduating with my bachelors. I am looking to be employed at a neuroscience research related company so that my expertise and knowledge I gained doing my bachelors will be valuable. I have taken all the medical pre-requisite classes, so will be graduating with a concentration in the medical sciences. Doing so has given me and extra boost in making myself more marketable as a candidate for the biotech field because I have the extra knowledge regarding medicine and health. With this, I will be able to add value to my company by adding necessary knowledge needed to work with hospitals, healthcare teams, and their needs.It is proven that a masters in business is most valuable after a  few years of experience in the job market. I am lookin to intern at companies that are right up my field now so that I may possibly be employed there after I graduate. After gaining a solid few years of  experience in the field, I plan to get my masters of business and climb my way up the biotech industry. <br><br>

        I have gained valuable hands on experiences in hospitals over the years, shadowing doctors and giving basic patient care. Working at hospitals and observing what happens there helped me to better understand the healthcare and bio industry not just through the health aspect, but also as a business. Once I gained the understanding of how the two work hand in hand, I decided I wanted a career that combined the two. To help me further myself  and be a better candidate for the biotech industry, I am learning how to code in the languages python and R. There are various coding projects I work on to perfect the skill and help me make myself as marketable as I can be. As the world turns to a more technology based society every day, coding is a very valuable skill to bring to the table in the job market. <br><br>

        I am also a research assistant in a neuroscience lab where I take EEG data, analyze it, and learn neural coding which is very important for the career I‚Äôm working towards. This lab at my university focuses on conducting research to ‚Äúunderstand the drivers of cognitive development and decline across the human lifespan with respect to learning and attention‚Äù. I run an EEG on patients while they wear an electrode cap. As they take a ‚Äútest‚Äù, we monitor their neural activity and spikes using a software. The data is then cleaned up and analyzed to see if there are any meaningful relations to answer our research questions. Once I have spent a good amount of time collecting data and researching in this lab, I plan to take part in a publication so that my research can be taken to the next level.
